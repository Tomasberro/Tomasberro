### Hi there,  IÂ´m Tomas! ðŸ‘‹

<h3> Full Stack Developer && Economist</h3>

Interested in data science, finance and blockchain.
I finished my software development studies at the bootcamp Soy Henry.
âœ¨ I built projects as a student, from a WeatherApp to a Pokedesk that allows you to see the available characters; the detail of each one; search by their respective name; create new pokemons and add or remove them from favorites.
âœ¨ I have also worked as a team developing a cinema App where it is possible to sell tickets and manage users; and an E-commerce for the sale of exclusive design shoes; with the possibility of online sales, stock management, statistics dashboard, user interface and promotions.
âœ¨ I am currently carrying out Data science projects .
